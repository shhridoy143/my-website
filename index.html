            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>Learning HTML and CSS is hard, but it doesn’t have to be. This 14-chapter tutorial is one of the
                friendliest HTML and CSS guides on the Internet. We’ll walk you through everything from selecting a good
                text editor (which is surprisingly important) to building full-fledged, professional-quality web pages
                from scratch.</p>

                <p>Are you a noob in all the fields of CS and want fast results with less studying? I was the same a few
                    months ago and honestly, the beginning results in web development were astounding. I have painfully
                    come
                    to the realization that development is not confined to just showing beautiful things on a browser.
